[00:02.24] Baby, baby, baby
[00:04.19] Baby, baby, baby
[00:05.65] Baby, baby, baby
[00:06.45] Baby, baby, baby
[00:07.57] Yeah!
[00:10.07] 
[00:09.82] (Oh...)
[00:10.91] (Hey yo)
[00:12.22] (You better get ready for this right now)
[00:15.14] (This is a battle scene...)
[00:17.46] (You can't stop it!)
[00:19.53] (Uh, get ready)
[00:22.13] (Take it hot, right now)
[00:34.13] 
[00:23.63] I thought told y'all to sit down or get down
[00:25.02] I'm about'a hit ground
[00:26.88] When I'm in the box, my hits way out of this bounds
[00:28.73] Nobody's topping me
[00:30.13] (You know it, damn right)
[00:30.73] Most of y'alls loving me
[00:32.08] (Doing it all night)
[00:42.08] 
[00:32.76] Keeping my friends close, and my foes closer
[00:34.49] Things getting messy, but I never lift the nose up
[00:36.75] As I get older, see things slower
[00:38.30] My enemies looking like kids, and I'm the grown up
[00:40.78] (Forget it)
[00:46.28] 
[00:41.18] I'm the next masterpiece made
[00:42.68] A new generation team, a wicked beast "ace"
[00:44.41] But I'm the mister nice guy
[00:46.13] See? I'm a wise guy
[00:46.98] Not a mafioso, but I hustle like Mike
[01:05.48] 
[00:48.77] Lay low if you're feelin' me
[00:50.86] I take these beats, freaks go crazy with me
[00:52.01] So put 'em up in this base with me
[00:54.44] So shake with the man, L to the J's, now follow me
[01:19.44]
